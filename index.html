                    <h3>LPG leakage detector</h3>
                    <p> Arduino UNO, MQ-6 gas sensor, 16×2 LCD module (2022) <br>
                        • So basically this project is useful when you are planning to secure your place from any type of gas leakage. <br>
                        • LPG gas is detected by the MQ-6 gas sensor in LPG Gas leakage detector using arduino then the green LED will go
                        on otherwise red LED will glow. <br>
                        • To make this project more interesting and user friendly we attach a 16×2 LCD module to it. <br>
                        • You can see the real time status of the working of the gas sensor in this LCD screen. <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub (2023) <br>
                       • Weather App for Website using HTML CSS and JavaScript. <br>
                       • Host on the GitHub. <br>
                       • display the weather information like Temperature, Weather condition, Humidity and Wind Speed according to the
                       city. <br>
                       • In this weather app we will add one search box where user can enter the city name and get the weather information
                       of the particular city. <br>
